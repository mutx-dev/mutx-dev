# MUTX upstream dependency report

Last verified: 2026-07-22

Faramesh Core and FPL were independently reverified on 2026-07-22.

This report separates three facts that older revisions conflated:

1. the current upstream release or head;
2. the historical ref from which MUTX adapted or generated local material; and
3. whether MUTX has actually validated compatibility with the current upstream.

Immutable license and source evidence is maintained in
[`docs/legal/oss-attribution-evidence.json`](legal/oss-attribution-evidence.json).

## Security hold: agent-run

The current upstream TypeScript entry point at
[`agent-run@9c7c3fa/typescript/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/builderz-labs/agent-run/blob/9c7c3fa68413de878fae2d605c90fb334a0201f6/typescript/src/index.ts)
contains behavior that requires coordinated security review before the package
can be trusted as a schema/types dependency. MUTX must not recommend, install,
import, vendor, execute, or update that package until the upstream maintainer has
resolved the review.

MUTX’s existing observability implementation consists of local adapted schemas
and does not need the upstream TypeScript package at runtime. The commit is
recorded as audit evidence, not as an upgrade target. Coordinate any disclosure
through the repository’s security process; do not publish secret material.

## Current AARM model

The authoritative requirements are pinned at
[`aarm-dev/docs@8eff208b/conformance/requirements.mdx`](https://github.com/aarm-dev/docs/blob/8eff208b98786b2c9a578b26cb7eaca440ec4020/conformance/requirements.mdx).

| ID | Level | Current meaning | MUTX status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | MUST | Pre-execution interception, blocking/deferral, no target effects, fail closed | Partial; not demonstrated |
| R2 | MUST | Context accumulation including data classification and original request | Partial; not demonstrated |
| R3 | MUST | Static and contextual policy evaluation with mandatory deferral conditions | Partial; not demonstrated |
| R4 | MUST | Distinct ALLOW, DENY, MODIFY, STEP_UP, and DEFER decisions | Partial; STEP_UP is not distinct |
| R5 | MUST | Complete signed and offline-verifiable receipts for every action | Partial; not demonstrated |
| R6 | MUST | Human, service, agent, session, role, and privilege identity binding | Partial; not demonstrated |
| R7 | SHOULD | Calibrated cumulative semantic-distance tracking | Gap; current heuristic is insufficient |
| R8 | SHOULD | Structured near-real-time telemetry, filtering, and historical export | Partial; not demonstrated |
| R9 | SHOULD | Just-in-time operation-scoped credentials | Gap; not demonstrated |

**AARM Core** requires all R1–R6 MUST requirements. **AARM Extended** adds
R7–R9. The upstream process also evaluates organizational conditions including
community engagement, an active production deployment, a relevant recognized
security certification, and benchmarking participation. MUTX has not published
evidence satisfying those conditions. See
[`docs/legal/aarm-alignment.md`](legal/aarm-alignment.md).

## Mission Control comparison baseline

Mission Control `v2.2.0` is pinned at
[`0552b00b`](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control/commit/0552b00b3b743ed12949e6deb19597655b02bbcc),
with `v2.1.0` / `b4ebc5418bea4fa9288a5c17fbddb9ba99740964`
retained as the comparison baseline. MUTX compares behavior rather than copying
Mission Control's API breadth wholesale. The historical dashboard port remains
pinned to upstream source commit
`eb7c35e950b83f73d6fd61e89f7d4b377db2ad50`, which introduced the briefing
pattern, and to MUTX port commit
`972ab49b0af83d15042b2301679246103cbdbab6`.

The v2.2.0 release adds strict workspace isolation and a host-CLI dispatch
sandbox. The directly applicable contract is the
[`task-dispatch.ts`](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control/blob/0552b00b3b743ed12949e6deb19597655b02bbcc/src/lib/task-dispatch.ts)
realpath-confined working directory and clamped execution-boundary design. MUTX
adapts that contract to its repository-native autonomous lanes:

- every runner resolves the exact Git worktree root before dispatch;
- declared path scopes reject traversal, `.git`, and symlink escapes;
- a dirty worktree blocks execution before an agent process starts;
- post-worker and post-verification changes outside `allowed_paths`, or above
  the clamped `max_changed_files` limit, fail closed before publication;
- rename checks inspect both the old and new paths; and
- the pre-dispatch commit is pinned, so worker-created commits cannot hide
  changes or bypass the orchestrator-owned publication step.

The implementation lives in `scripts/autonomy/work_order_sandbox.py` and is
enforced by the Codex, OpenCode, and main-lane runners. Focused regression
coverage lives in `tests/test_autonomy_work_order_sandbox.py`.

The broader upstream workspace database model, host-administration routes,
gateway registry, and filesystem API are not copied: MUTX uses a different
authenticated FastAPI control plane and resource ownership model. The two
historically adapted briefing components changed only Tailwind utility names in
v2.2.0, so there is no behavioral dashboard delta to port from this release.

High-value comparison areas remain:

- framework and gateway adapters;
- session lifecycle and transcript controls;
- webhook delivery history and retry behavior;
- skill registry synchronization and security scanning;
- agent evaluation and quality-review surfaces.

Each adoption should be its own issue/PR with compatibility tests and attribution.

## Faramesh and FPL license obligations

Faramesh Core current main and FPL current main are Apache-2.0, not MIT. The
pinned Core `v0.2.0` release and historical `v1.2.9` tag are MPL-2.0. The
audited refs contain no root `NOTICE` file. MUTX retains the verbatim
third-party Apache-2.0 text at `third_party/licenses/Apache-2.0.txt` and the
verbatim MPL-2.0 text at `third_party/licenses/MPL-2.0.txt`. A later relicense
on main does not retroactively relicense an earlier tag. If a future upstream ref adds
`NOTICE`, that material must be carried into the distribution when applicable.
“AARM-aligned” is the accurate upstream status for Faramesh and does not prove
MUTX conformance.

The 2026-07-22 audit found that both upstream repositories changed only their
root `LICENSE` formatting after MUTX's prior refs. Core's CLI/socket/runtime
code and FPL's EBNF, specification, AST schema, and examples did not change.
Neither current tree contains a root `NOTICE` file.

Compatibility was tested against the published `v0.2.0` Darwin ARM64 asset
(`sha256:6b89acce83e1b7dcbd3079f50c4762dc2657886413e3e3262d23f8d144a9ea24`).
The published contract uses `faramesh --version`, `status`, `govern`,
`poll_defer`, `approve_defer`, `agent {op: pending}`, and an apply-generated
`.faramesh/bin/agent` launcher. It does not expose the former MUTX assumptions
`faramesh version`, `faramesh run`, `faramesh policy validate`, or the
`evaluate`, `gate_decide`, `action_submit`, and `policy_reload` socket aliases.
MUTX now uses the published operations and validates standalone FPL by loading
it in an isolated daemon. The four bundled policies compile and reach socket
readiness through the pinned release.

## Integration migration order

1. Keep agent-run quarantined and use only MUTX’s local adapted schema.
2. Close the AARM naming and claim drift before adding new conformance features.
3. Validate the pinned Faramesh Core `v0.2.0` release and current FPL in an isolated compatibility lane.
4. Keep the regenerated Orchestra v1.7.2 catalog and curated reference checks green.
5. Keep predict-rlm `v0.7.3` compatibility green across every managed/local workflow contract.
6. Keep Mission Control's v2.2.0 runner-boundary adaptation covered while
   reviewing later releases only for roadmap-backed behavioral contracts.

## Automated drift reporting

[`docs/upstream-tracking.json`](upstream-tracking.json) maps this attribution
evidence and the Pico engine release pins to explicit GitHub metadata checks.
Run `python scripts/check_upstream_drift.py` for a live report. The checker only
reads repository, commit, tag, and release metadata; it never clones, imports,
vendors, or executes upstream code.

The metadata audit shares the existing daily/manual
`Infrastructure Drift Detection` workflow instead of creating another scheduled
workflow. It writes a step summary and a 30-day JSON artifact. Live
mutable-network checks remain outside pull-request CI, while the authoritative
path-aware CI selects the offline registry tests whenever the registry or
attribution evidence changes. Drift is reported without making the scheduled
lane red; registry inconsistencies, API failures, and moved immutable pins fail
closed.

A drift result is a review signal, not authorization to update or import an
upstream. Triage and compatibility work remains scoped by
[SOTA modernization epic #3688](https://github.com/mutx-dev/mutx-dev/issues/3688).

## Changelog

### 2026-07-22

- Verified PyPI `0.7.3` and GitHub tag `v0.7.3` at immutable commit
  `e7f1e5df7d0188861b39142094b4b738f456972f`.
- Confirmed that the v0.7.2-to-v0.7.3 core API remains compatible with MUTX's
  `File`, `Skill`, and `PredictRLM` integration and existing output contracts.
- Recorded the release wheel and source-distribution SHA-256 digests and raised
  MUTX's backend runtime floor to `predict-rlm>=0.7.3,<1`.
- The release's functional change is isolated to the optional `codex-lm` extra,
  which now supports the GPT-5.6 family; MUTX does not load that extra in its
  document workflow engine.
- Verified Mission Control `v2.2.0` at immutable commit
  `0552b00b3b743ed12949e6deb19597655b02bbcc` and retained `v2.1.0` as the
  explicit comparison baseline.
- Adapted its host-CLI working-directory and bounded-dispatch contract to all
  MUTX autonomy runners with fail-closed path and change-count checks.
- Confirmed the historical briefing port has no applicable v2.2.0 behavioral
  delta; its immutable source and local-port provenance remain unchanged.
- Regenerated the Orchestra Research catalog from the immutable v1.7.2 commit.
- Added the three Agent-Native Research Artifact skills introduced upstream.
- Added deterministic catalog generation and closed the dangling multimodal
  template/blueprint references in the original integration.

### 2026-07-15

- Replaced mutable and broken evidence with immutable commit/tag links.
- Corrected agent-run and Mission Control copyright years to 2026.

- Corrected AARM’s repository license notice to Copyright (c) 2023 Mintlify.
- Replaced the obsolete AARM requirement numbering with the current Core/Extended model.
- Corrected Faramesh/FPL from MIT and recorded the ref-specific split: Core main
  and FPL main are Apache-2.0, while the pinned Core `v0.2.0` release and
  historical `v1.2.9` tag are MPL-2.0.
- Updated Mission Control to `v2.1.0`, Orchestra to `v1.7.2`, and predict-rlm to `v0.7.2`.
- Marked LACP identity/license as unresolved and removed the unsupported MIT claim.

### 2026-04-16

- Initial upstream dependency report (now superseded by the verified record above).
